<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](http://math.hanyang.ac.kr/frontpage.asp?catalogid=math&language=en&calltype=redirect) at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng) and hold an affiliated faculty position at the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.hanyang.ac.kr) at Hanyang University. My research mainly focuses on Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography (PEC), which aims to develop advanced cryptographic primitives to protect sensitive data of individuals. 
In particular, I have been actively working on the development of homomorphic encryption, which enables to compute any function on encrypted data without decryption. Also, I have been working on privacy-preserving protocols in a wide range of applications such as data query processing, genomic analysis, and machine learning.
